# GPS File Management System - Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the step-by-step tasks required to implement the GPS file management system for WayBinder, as described in the implementation plan in `docs/guides/enhanced-mapgl.md`. The tasks are organized into phases, with each phase building upon the previous one.

## Overview

The GPS file management system will allow users to:

1. Upload GPS files (GPX, KML, FIT, TCX) as part of activity creation/editing
2. Automatically extract and display statistics (distance, elevation, duration)
3. View activities on interactive maps with elevation profiles
4. Edit GPS data (add/remove/modify points)
5. Merge multiple GPS files for complex activities
6. Download processed files in various formats

## Key Improvements and Considerations

Based on research and best practices, this implementation plan includes the following key improvements:

1. **Modern Library Selection:** Using gpxjs over gpx-parse for better TypeScript support and modern JavaScript features
2. **Performance Optimization:** Implementing server-side simplification with Turf.js for large GPS files
3. **Responsive Processing:** Using Web Workers for client-side processing to prevent UI blocking
4. **User Experience:** Enhanced progress tracking for large file uploads and processing
5. **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
6. **Accessibility:** Ensuring map components are accessible with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
7. **Testing:** Adding comprehensive unit and integration tests for GPS utilities and endpoints

### Data Flow

1. **File Upload Flow:**
   - User uploads GPS file(s) in the activity creation/editing form
   - Client-side Web Worker performs initial validation and preview generation
   - Frontend sends the file to the `/api/gps/upload` endpoint using TanStack Query mutation with progress tracking
   - Backend processes the file with streaming:
     - Parses the file format (GPX, KML, FIT, TCX) with appropriate parser
     - Extracts track data and converts to standardized GeoJSON
     - Applies noise filtering and data cleaning
     - Creates multiple simplification levels for different zoom levels
     - Calculates comprehensive statistics (distance, elevation, duration, etc.)
     - Stores the processed data in the database
   - Backend returns success response with statistics and simplified preview data
   - Frontend updates the form with the extracted statistics and shows map preview

2. **Viewing Flow:**
   - When viewing an activity with GPS data:
     - Frontend fetches appropriate GeoJSON detail level based on viewport
     - Map component renders the track using MapLibre GL with optimized rendering
     - Statistics are displayed with proper formatting and unit conversion
     - Elevation profile is rendered with interactive highlighting
     - Additional data layers (speed, grade, heart rate) are available for toggle

3. **Editing Flow:**
   - User enters edit mode for an activity
   - Full-resolution GeoJSON is fetched if not already cached
   - User makes changes in the map editor interface:
     - Point additions, removals, or modifications
     - Segment operations (split, join, reverse)
     - Track simplification or smoothing
   - Changes are tracked in an undo/redo history
   - On save, changes are sent to the backend for processing
   - Backend recalculates statistics and simplification levels
   - Updated GeoJSON and statistics are returned and stored
   - UI is updated with the new data and edit mode is exited

4. **Merging Flow:**
   - User selects multiple activities to merge
   - Preview is generated showing the combined route
   - User configures merge options (time adjustments, conflict resolution)
   - Merge request is sent to the backend
   - Backend processes the merge with progress updates:
     - Combines trackpoints from all sources
     - Resolves conflicts according to strategy
     - Creates a new unified GeoJSON
     - Calculates combined statistics
   - New or updated activity is created with the merged data
   - User is redirected to the new activity view

### State Management Strategy

- **TanStack Query:** Will manage server state including:
  - GPS file upload mutations with progress tracking
  - GeoJSON data fetching with detail level parameters
  - Statistics and trackpoint data with caching
  - Analysis and merge operations with cancellation support
  - Background processing status monitoring

- **Zustand:** Will manage client-side UI state:
  - Map viewport settings (zoom, center, bearing, pitch)
  - Selected activities/layers with visibility toggles
  - UI mode (viewing, editing, merging, analyzing)
  - Panel visibility and layout options
  - Edit history and undo/redo stack
  - User preferences and settings

- **nuqs:** Will manage URL state for:
  - Selected activity IDs for sharing specific views
  - Map position, zoom, and bearing for shareable map states
  - Active view mode and selected panels
  - Filter settings for activity lists
  - Comparison mode parameters

## Progress Tracking

To track progress on this implementation, we'll use the following status indicators:

- [ ] Not started
- [ðŸ”„] In progress
- [âœ…] Completed

Team members should update the status of tasks as they work on them, and add comments or notes about any challenges or decisions made during implementation.

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Use streaming for file uploads and processing to handle large files efficiently
- Implement multiple detail levels for GeoJSON to optimize rendering at different zoom levels
- Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive operations to keep the UI responsive
- Implement efficient caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Use virtualization for large data tables and lists
- Consider using WebGL for rendering complex tracks

### Security Considerations

- Validate all file uploads for size, type, and content
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Consider privacy implications of GPS data sharing

### Accessibility

- Ensure all components are keyboard navigable
- Add proper ARIA attributes to custom controls
- Provide alternative text descriptions for map features
- Support screen readers for important data and interactions
- Maintain good color contrast for all UI elements
- Provide alternative ways to access information shown on maps

## Conclusion

This comprehensive task list provides a detailed roadmap for implementing a state-of-the-art GPS file management system in WayBinder. By following these tasks in sequence and incorporating the recommended improvements, we can ensure a systematic and organized approach to development.

The implementation will result in a robust, performant, and user-friendly feature that:

1. Provides excellent user experience with intuitive interfaces
2. Handles large and complex GPS files efficiently
3. Offers advanced editing and analysis capabilities
4. Integrates seamlessly with the existing journey and activity features
5. Works well across different devices and connection speeds
6. Is accessible to users with disabilities
7. Can be extended with new capabilities in the future

This feature will significantly enhance the overall application experience and provide users with powerful tools for managing their outdoor activities.
