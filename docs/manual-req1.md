# Waybinder Functionalities

Its a platform to  track, organize, and share your outdoor journeys with day-by-day activities with eloborate experence and interactive maps.

## Problem statement

I need to have a platform where I can share all my Multi day events or trucks or my journey. Combined with my experience to do list Hinds and other things. Share it to the public in an intuitive way.
One more Issue we are trying to solve is Navigating through the multi day event right If I am searching for some tricks, a multi day trek Currently, I can find only the full stretch blog items. And if I need to figure out the exact timeline and how the day and activity has been split, its really hard to understand the individual activity

From from public user perspective, it is kind of blogging platform where we can read all about the journey in an intuitive way for multi day events
From athletes perspective, it is a platform where We can log or log our entire. Journey with day wise split and within a day activity wise split and a detailed description or blog about that particular activity. We can add a GPX file for the particular Activity And Items or things that we have Take with And the planning we have done, and the permissions we need for that trick and the terrain condition, weather condition. So we can find, or we can update, each and every. In depth detail of that particular journey and particular activity.****

- In a separate tab Within the platform (a standalone fucntionality), we should be having an option to merge the gpx file. And export the merged GPX file Basically we should allow the user to upload more than one GPX file and allow them to edit the details of the gpx file , merge it and export them

## Solution need to be figured out

- We should find a solution how we can allow the other athletes as well to collaborate with the same journey Because 4 of us have gone to the same Trek or summit or whatever may be Different person will have a different experience and different things to share. We need to find a way how they can collaborate or what kind of information we can allow the individual athlete to update. We should be having some restrictions. If I am initiating Journey then only certain things can be added by the other athletes
- What happens if one of my friend who came with me for this journey wants to write his own separate journey within the same platform Then the activity will be redundant, the same kind of information will be added to the same platform We need to find a way how we can avoid it It should be a single entry. Anyone can Start the journey but all the other athletes can add the information within the same journey. We should not allow the other user to create a duplicate or redundant journey for the same activity
